# External Authentication Providers

*grouprise* can be configured to use external authentication sources
(e.g. social platforms). This allows users to re-use existing external accounts
instead of memorizing another password for a local account.

There is a variety of Django applications adding support for connecting to
[external OAuth providers](https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/oauth/).

The
[list of Django authentication applications](https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/authentication/)
mentions even more options based on different protocols.
