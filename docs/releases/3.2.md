# Grouprise 3.2.0

Release date: *unreleased*


## Mail processing

* The management command `processincomingmessage` is superseded by the new
  command `import_mail_message`.
* The configuration setting `MAILBOX_DELIVERED_TO_EMAIL` is superseded by the
  setting `COLLECTOR_MAILBOX_ADDRESS` (for `import_mail_message`).
* Retrieval of mails from an IMAP server is not supported anymore.
  The LMTP server provided by *grouprise* is the preferred alternative (with
  proper handling of CC and BCC addresses).

See [mail setup](../mail_setup) for details.
