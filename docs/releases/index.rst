Release Notes
=============

..
   Please note: *always* use the full (three-digit) version number for the filename (the title
   may differ).  This is required for the automatic creation of gitlab releases in the CI pipeline.
   The old filenames below are just kept for preserving stable links.
   Maybe we should switch to one of sphinx's redirect extensions somewhen.
