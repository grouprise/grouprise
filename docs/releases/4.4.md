# Grouprise 4.4.0

Release date: *2021-11-??*

## Calendar Events

Ongoing events (starting in the past and ending in the future) were previously not displayed in the
calendar.
Now these are displayed along with the relative time of the event's starting time.
This should improve the visualization of slightly longer events (lasting a few hours or days).
But it may be necessary to adjust this feature, if events lasting multiple weeks start to appear.


## Administration

It is now possible to specify `postgis` (a spatial database extension) as a database engine in
*grouprise*'s configuration.
This can be useful for applications extending *grouprise*.
Previously it was necessary to resort to the raw django configuration
(via `extra_django_settings_filenames`).
