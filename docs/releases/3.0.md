# Grouprise 3.0

Release date: *2020-08-12*

## Name change

The application was renamed from *stadtgestalten* to *grouprise* in order to widen its scope
(being used for non-german deployments).  The interface is still focussed on German texts for now.
The script for managing a local instance is now called `grouprisectl` instead of `stadtctl`.

## Branding options

Site-specific style options are now configurable (instead of overwriting or injecting CSS files).
See [Configuration](../configuration/options.html).

## Conversations

A list of unread messages is now available.

## Mail handling

* Add support for LMTP-based mail reception.  This improves the handling of incoming emails (e.g.
  for CC and BCC delivery) and reduces the amount of backscatter caused by spam.
  See [Email handling](../email_handling.html) for details.
* Preserve timestamps of incoming emails: previously the timestamp of *processing* was used instead
  of the timestamp of *sending* a mail.

## Problems

* The group tags are lost during the upgrade from 2.x to 3.x
  (see [#694](https://git.hack-hro.de/grouprise/grouprise/-/issues/694)).
  Since grouprise v3.1.1 these tags can be restored from a database backup created before the
  upgrade: `grouprisectl restore_tags DATABASE_DUMP_FILE`.
