# Grouprise 4.8.1

Release date: *2022-02-13*

## Administration

* file downloads are now handled by the proxy server (e.g. `X-Sendfile`), if `file_download_backend` is configured
    * this is the default for the `deb`-package deployment


## Bug fixes

* tolerate duplicate tags, only differing via lower/upper case (e.g. `foo` and `Foo`) caused rendering exceptions
* add missing dependency on `celery`, which is temporarily necessary as a workaround for `django-oauth-toolkit`
