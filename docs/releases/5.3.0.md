# Grouprise 5.3.0

Release date: *2022-12-24*


## Administration

* new setting [`data_path`](../administration/configuration/options.html#data-path):
  the directory containing all locally stored data can be specified explicitly now
* configuration directories are now processed recursively (previously: only files in the first level were processed)
* direct file access (below `/stadt/media/`) is now handled by Django redirects in order to enforce
  proper permission and ownership handling


## Contact form (captcha)

Contact forms can be used by anonymous visitors.
These were protected by a simple math puzzle before.
Since these math puzzles proved to be rather ineffective recently, we switched to trivial questions now.


## Matrix Chat

* administration: the following `scopes` need to be added to
  `/etc/matrix-synapse/conf.d/grouprise-matrix-authentication.yaml`
  (the file is automatically generated for a [deb-based deployment](../deployment/deb)):
    * `email`
    * `profile`
