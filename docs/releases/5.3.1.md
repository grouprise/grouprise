# Grouprise 5.3.1

Release date: *2022-12-28*


## Administration

The following changes are relevant for the [deb-based deployment](/deployment/deb) only:

* `/var/lib/grouprise/site-data/` is published as `/-/site/` (e.g. for local branding assets)
* the setting `templates_directories` now defaults to `/etc/grouprise/templates/`
  (simplifying local template overrides)
