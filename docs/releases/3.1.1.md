# Grouprise 3.1.1

Release date: *2021-01-06*


## Helper for restoring lost group tags

* During the upgrade from grouprise 2.x to 3.x the tags associated with a group got lost.
  These can be restored now from a database backup created before the upgrade:
  `grouprisectl restore_tags DATABASE_DUMP_FILE`.
  See [#694](https://git.hack-hro.de/grouprise/grouprise/-/issues/694) for details.
