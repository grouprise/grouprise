# Grouprise 4.5.0

Release date: *2021-11-23*

## Matrix Commander

The [Matrix Commander](/management/matrix_commander) now supports a few more commands for managing
a *grouprise* instance:

* `content visibility URL STATE`
* `content ownership URL GROUP_OR_USER`
* `user join USERNAME GROUPNAME`
* `user leave USERNAME GROUPNAME`
* `user admin list`
* `user admin grant USERNAME`
* `user admin revoke USERNAME`

In addition it is now possible to use the *Matrix Commander* interface locally in a shell (without
a Matrix client):
```shell
grouprisectl matrix_commander --console
```
