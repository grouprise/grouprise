# Grouprise 5.4.2

Release date: *2023-??-??*


## Bugfixes

* fix submission of simple poll votes
* fix statistics collection of the Matrix commander bot
* Tolerate case-insensitive references of entities (Gestalt or Group).
  Now `@Foo` would match the group `foo`.
  Previously the "unknown group/gestalt" message would be rendered instead.
