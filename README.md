# grouprise

grouprise is a platform destined to encourage and enable social action and solidarity in the context of your city. Bildet Banden!

## Quick Setup

### For administrators
You may want to install the latest [snapshot build](https://git.hack-hro.de/grouprise/grouprise/builds/artifacts/master/raw/build/debian/export/grouprise.deb?job=deb-package) as a deb package. Please note that this is a rather dirty package (embedded dependencies; suitable for Debian Buster).

### For developers

The *local source* approach described below is suitable for developing the code of grouprise itself.
The *system in docker* approach is helpful for developing integrations with other packages (e.g. a mail server or matrix).

#### Local Source

1. You will need [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (downloaded automatically if unavailable), [python3](https://www.python.org/), [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to get started. If you have all of those, you may proceed :). Otherwise see the Dependencies Section
2. Run `make app_run` and wait until you see something like `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

#### System in Docker

1. generate a docker image containing a prepared Debian Buster image. It is ready for installing
grouprise's [deb packages](./-/blob/master/docs/deployment/deb.md) from grouprise's apt repository
or for testing locally built deb packages:
```shell
docker build --tag=grouprise-deb-prepared docker/grouprise-deb-prepared
```
2. enter an interactive shell in the system:
```shell
docker run --tty --interactive --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd),destination=/app" --publish 8000:80 --workdir=/app grouprise-deb-prepared "$SHELL"
```
3. install released packages from the official apt repository or locally built deb packages:
```shell
# a) install released grouprise packages
apt install grouprise
# b) install locally built packages
dpkg -i build/debian/grouprise_*.deb
```


## Dependencies

Depending on your distribution (we assume youâ€™ll be using something like Linux here) the build dependencies of this project will be available via your package manager.

Some additional dependencies will be downloaded during the build process:

* pip (Python): `requirements.txt`
* npm (NodeJS): `package.json`

### Debian
For `virtualenv`, `python3`, `flake8` and `pip` use apt:
```sh
apt install make virtualenv python3 python3-flake8 python3-pip python3-sphinx python3-recommonmark python3-xapian
```

Additionally `node` v8.12 or later and `npm` are required.  Both are available in Stretch-Backports and Buster.  If you do not have a suitable version installed, it will be automatically downloaded when running `make` (see `make.d/nodejs.mk`).

### Arch Linux
Fortunately all of the required packages are available via pacman.
```sh
pacman -Sy make nodejs npm flake8 python python-virtualenv python-pip python-sphinx python-recommonmark python-xapian
```


## Local Settings

Your local Django settings will be located in `stadt/settings/local.py`. Use `make app_local_settings` to create a default configuration. 


## Database Setup

The preconfigured database is a local sqlite file.
For production deployment you should use a database server.

### PostgreSQL

The following statement creates a suitable database including proper collation settings:

    CREATE USER grouprise WITH PASSWORD 'put random noise';
    CREATE DATABASE grouprise WITH ENCODING 'UTF8' LC_COLLATE='de_DE.UTF8' LC_CTYPE='de_DE.UTF8' TEMPLATE=template0 OWNER grouprise;

The command above requires the locale 'de_DE.UTF8' in the system of the database server.


## Docker deployment

[Docker](https://docker.io/) may be used for a quick and dirty way to set up an instance of
grouprise.

The docker image based on the latest released deb package of grouprise can be built easily:
```sh
docker build docker/grouprise-deb-prepared
```

Run `/usr/bin/grouprise-start-services` within the built docker image for starting all grouprise related services.


## Production deployment

We recommend to use the provided deb package. It contains an nginx and UWSGI configuration.

See also [deb.md](./docs/deployment/deb.md).
