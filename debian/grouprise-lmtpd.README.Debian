Grouprise can handle incoming emails either indirectly by collecting
them from an IMAP mailbox (requires a periodic cron job) or directly
by offering an LMTP service which injects the mails at their time of
arrival.

This package (grouprise-lmtpd) provides the LMTP based service.


1. Configuration

The systemd service "grouprise-lmtpd" is automatically enabled after
installing the package.

It works out of the box.  The only additional requirement is a
configured local mail server (e.g. postfix) handing incoming mails
over to the LMTP service.


2. Example postfix configuration

virtual_mailbox_domains = example.org
virtual_transport = lmtp:inet:localhost:1025
# Use the line below or just add "reject_unverified_recipient" to an
# existing "smtpd_recipient_restrictions".
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_unverified_recipient

The above configuration delivers all mails directed at the specified
domain to the local LMTP service provided by grouprise.
